I developed a sophisticated system that enhances the gaming experience by making a player's character nearly invisible when they are inactive. 

This system detects when a player has been away from their keyboard (AFK) for a specified duration or when they close the Roblox window. 

Upon such inactivity, the character becomes nearly invisible, effectively reducing their visibility to other players. 

This feature is particularly useful for maintaining the game's dynamic and immersive environment, as it helps manage inactive players and minimizes disruption within active gameplay areas.
