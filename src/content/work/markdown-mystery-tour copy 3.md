I designed and implemented a comprehensive system for an adventure game, featuring several key elements to enhance gameplay and immersion. This system includes health and thirst bars that provide players with vital information about their characterâ€™s status and needs. To further engage players, I integrated a gamepass feature that allows users to purchase and unlock additional health, providing them with an advantage and extending their gameplay experience.

Additionally, the system includes interactive bottles that players can fill up, which adds a layer of strategy for managing their thirst and survival in the game. To complement these features, I also incorporated flashlights that players can use to navigate through dark or dimly lit environments, enhancing the exploration and adventure aspects of the game.

Overall, this system is designed to create a more engaging and dynamic adventure experience, with elements that require careful management and strategic use.
