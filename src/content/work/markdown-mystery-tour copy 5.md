I developed a basic tycoon system themed around an amusement park for a Roblox game. 

This system allows players to build and manage their own amusement park, simulating various aspects of park management. Players can construct rides, food stalls, and other attractions, gradually expanding their park and increasing its profitability. 

The system includes fundamental tycoon mechanics such as earning in-game currency, investing in new attractions, and managing park resources to create a fun and engaging experience for players.
