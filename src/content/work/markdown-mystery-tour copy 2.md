I developed an advanced overhead GUI system that enhances user interaction within the game. This system displays the player's username prominently, ensuring clear identification during gameplay. 

Additionally, it integrates with the playerâ€™s group, allowing the GUI to dynamically display a rank or role above the player's head that corresponds to their position within the group. 

This feature is particularly useful for role-playing games, where displaying a player's group affiliation and rank adds depth to the gaming experience and fosters a more immersive environment. The system is designed for seamless integration and efficient performance, providing a valuable tool for both players and game administrators.
