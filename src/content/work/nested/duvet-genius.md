I designed and implemented a comprehensive Admin UI for a Roblox game, featuring a range of administrative functions to enhance gameplay management. 

This user interface includes a 'Ban Player' function, which allows administrators to permanently ban disruptive players from the game, effectively preventing them from rejoining.

Additionally, the UI includes a 'Get Admin Pet' function, enabling admins to summon a unique in-game pet with special attributes that are not available to regular players. 

The 'Kick Player' feature offers the ability to remove players from the server with an option to provide a reason for their removal, ensuring that game administrators can manage player behavior effectively. 

Another crucial function is 'Shutdown Server,' which allows for the immediate termination of the game server, useful for maintenance or emergency situations. 

Finally, the 'View Player' function provides admins with detailed information about players, including their current status and in-game activities, facilitating better oversight and management. 

Each of these features was carefully coded to ensure smooth functionality and integration within the game environment.
