I developed a comprehensive hot zone system for competitive gameplay, designed to enhance team-based interactions. 

The system features two teams that compete to capture and control a designated zone within the game. Both teams enter the zone and work to maintain control over it, earning points every 10 seconds that they hold the zone. The objective is to be the first team to reach 15 points, which determines the winner of the match.

I coded the entire system from scratch, ensuring seamless functionality and accurate point tracking. 

This implementation promotes strategic gameplay and team coordination, adding a dynamic and competitive element to the gaming experience.
