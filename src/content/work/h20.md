I developed a robust shop system for a Roblox simulator game, allowing players to purchase various perks and gamepasses using Robux. 

This shop enables players to enhance their gameplay experience by acquiring boosts such as a x2 speed multiplier, which accelerates their in-game actions, and increased luck when opening eggs, improving their chances of obtaining rare items. 

I meticulously programmed the shop to ensure smooth transactions and effective application of these perks, enhancing player engagement and providing additional layers of customization and advantage within the simulator.
