I designed and coded an intricate egg-hatching system for a Roblox game that incorporates luck-based mechanics to determine the rarity of pets obtained. The system uses specialized luck tables to generate different types of pets when eggs are hatched, adding an element of excitement and unpredictability to the gameplay.

To enhance the hatching experience, I integrated a Billboard GUI that visually represents the hatching process, providing players with engaging and informative feedback. Additionally, I developed a comprehensive menu that allows players to view and manage the pets they have unlocked, offering an organized and user-friendly interface to track their collection.

This system combines complex mechanics with intuitive design elements to create a rewarding and immersive pet-hatching experience.
